# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

If you're looking at this GitHub profile, I'm assuming you're one of three people
- You are one of my friends: Welcome to my GitHub page. Feel free to browse around and roast my code!
- You are an employer trying to determine whether or not I'm worth hiring: Please hire me! I promise I'll be able to do the job effectively!
- You're a random internet user who came across one of my projects: I hope what I made lives up to what you hoped to get. Let me know if you want to collab on a project in the near future
