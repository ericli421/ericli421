This is a detailed list of ideas I had that I'm writing down here. I might do them in the future, emphasis on might

# Ambitious Ideas

The following ideas are incredibly large scale and would either require the support of a team, years of time, or both. Some of these projects hover over the line of unfeasability.
These projects would fall way beyond the scope of learning, and all feature a unique goal to contribute to society in some way, shape, or form.
Due to the scope of these ideas, they will be described very throuroughly as I list my thoughts about each of them

## University Course Database

A database for the courses of most (hopefully all) high-level education institutions in the world, 
relating to the courses they are equivalent to in other institutions, free online resources to learn the material presented in those courses, 
and general guidance to students who are looking to take those courses about what they're learning and how it will help them move forward

### Motivation
I had this idea one day when I was reflecting on my university degree. Being a student in Computer Science studying during the rise of Artificial Intelligence
I was evaluating my choice of planning to not take an advanced Statistics course in my degree.
This is when I thought that it would be nice to just take the course material on my free time without the stress of a university course load.

Finding online resources to study each topic should be pretty easy in the digital era we live in. 
The difficult part is figuring out what exactly you need. The most popular online resources go with a very surface level overview of every topic.
This is fine for the lower level courses, but isn't enough as you progress higher into your education. 
This is where the root of this idea stems from. A database for every course with free online resources 
that can be used to either learn or enrich your knowledge of the course's topics

### Objectives
- Make High-Level Education more accessible to people overall
- Relieve stress in students by allowing an easy way to delve into a course's material

### Restrictions and Drawbacks
A major restriction about this idea is the sheer scope of it. It would take hundreds of willing contributors to complete the information database about a
single high-level education institution, let alone all of them. Not to mention mention all the different languages that would need to be supported, 
the verification of copyright rights of each resource. 

Even if the database gets fully written, it would still need to be regularly maintained, such as filtering trolls and updating information. This is especially true
for higher level courses about topics that aren't set in stone. An example would be a theoretical biology course that studies a certain model of a protein. 
If later research determine that the protein's role or model is much different than what was previously hypothesized, then that entire section would have to be updated. 
All fields might encounter this problem at some point with some of the most likely including most STEM fields, topics related to human behaviour, 
and topics about the recent world.

This is also a lot less helpful when relating to courses that aren't theoretical in nature. This database would only really be helpful for theory focused topics/classes.
This isn't necessarily bad, but it is a drawback that might hurt the motivation of this project ever being finished.

## Full fledged Video Game

A fully developped, fully polished video game with a captivating narrative story, fun gameplay, beautiful art style and music and a strong theme and message

### Motivation
I've been playing video games for most of my life. A lot of the titles I got into were indie titles, developped by small teams. My favorites include
- [Undertale](https://undertale.com/), developed almost singlehandedly by Toby Fox, I admire the story telling devices of this game
- [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com/), developed by a team of 3, I admire the natural world design in this game
- [Celeste](https://www.celestegame.com/), developed by a team of around 10, I admire the gameplay design philosophy of this game
- [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/), developed singlehandedly by Zeekerss, I admire the balancing of elements in this game
- [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/), developed singlehandedly by LocalThunk, I admire the creativity this game has on an old classic

Naturally, this inspired me to one day develop a game of my own that I can proudly present to the world.

My biggest obstacle with this idea at first however, is that I severely lacked the creativity to develop a game of this scale. However, one random day in Feburary 2025,
my creative light shone through and I received the game idea I was so desperately looking for. After writing it down, I started planning on and off ideas on what to 
include in the game. The idea is nothing more than random text scribbes so far, and scattered ideas on a skeleton that I have yet to flesh out, but is slowly worked on to come together 
as I get more ideas on how I should proceed with every facet of this game.

### Objectives
- Make a fun, well polished video game for the world to enjoy
- Create a memorable experience for those who wish to experience it.

### Restrictions and Drawbacks
The one element that scares me above anything else above this project is creativity. 
There are many facets that go into developing a good game: Art, Music, Gameplay, Theme, Story, Difficulty, etc.
I am confident about being able to tacking the development and design of all of them, but if I decide to develop it solo,
I'm dreading art and music the most, and level design the second most, as I've struggled many times with coming with creative ideas and fighting my perfectionism

# Major Ideas

The following ideas are smaller scale and may take months to complete. All these projects have to goal to further my skills and knowledge in the field,
while simultaniously creating something cool to show to the world. They will all feature a brief description

### Esoteric programming language
An esoteric programming language is designed to experiement with weird ideas with the most famous one being [Brainf&^k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). 
They are not designed for main stream use and are generally so confusing and unintuitive to use that 
that they make even the most confusing C++ gibberish look easily readable in comparison.
The goal for me in this idea would be to brainstorm the quirkiest idea for a programming language I can come up with and fully develop a compiler to make it hypoethetically usable to create any program possible

**Objectives:**
- Develop a working compiler for a programming language
- Write proper documentation for said programming language
- Memes

**Status:** Not started

### Discord Chat bot
As a regular discord user, I want to create a bot that can do a lot of things. This can be very simple, but I do want to try and work on more advanced features.

**Objectives:**
- Familiarize with developing a chat bot application
- Experience backend development scenarios

**Status:** Not started

### AI bot
The idea is to create an themed AI bot that can generate something when asked, although that something hasn't been decided yet. 

Current ideas: 

- Taylor Swift lyrics
- Stupid short story prompts
- Images
- AI girlfriend chat

**Objectives:**

- Familiarize with working with AI models
- Memes

**Status:** Not started


### Algorithm/Data Structure visualizer
I am ***(currently)*** a big fan of various algorithms and data structures. I want to be able to build an app or site that allows me to see various algorithms in action or a visualization of popular data strctures. 
Current ones I want to explore are sorting algorithms and trees.

**Objectives:**
- Solidify my understanding of popular algorithms and data strctures
- Fully experience front end development

**Status:** Not started

# Minor ideas

The following ideas are very small scale and shouldn't take longer than a month to complete, hopefully. These will mostly be fun projects that are mostly there to let me do cool stuff

- [ ] **[r/badUIBattles](https://www.reddit.com/r/badUIbattles/) entry:** An entry that can safely be posted into that subreddit. Promote inefficiency!
- [ ] **Score counter:** Score counter application I can use in badminton tournaments.
- [ ] **Clone of popular video game:** Will familiarize me with game engine while simultaneously allow me to go completely meme mode.
- [ ] **Finish the stupid [blender donut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4haAdmHqGOw):** I tried unsuccessfully finishing this tutorial 3 times already :sob:
